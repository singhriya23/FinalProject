## üéì AI College Recommendation System ‚Äì User Guide

Welcome to the AI College Recommendation System! This intelligent app helps you discover, compare, and explore top U.S. universities using structured and unstructured data combined with real-time search and global rankings.

## üöÄ What You Can Do
Get college recommendations based on your preferences (e.g., tuition, GPA, program type)

Compare colleges side-by-side on stats, courses, and faculty

Ask questions about specific programs (AI, CS, Data Science)

View QS global rankings

Get fallback answers using real-time web search

## üñ•Ô∏è How to Use the App
1. Open the App
You‚Äôll be greeted by a clean Streamlit interface with a prompt box and submit button.

2. Enter a Prompt
Type in a natural language query. Here are some examples:

  üí° ‚ÄúRecommend CS colleges with tuition under $40,000‚Äù

  üí° ‚ÄúCompare Stanford and MIT for Artificial Intelligence programs‚Äù

  üí° ‚ÄúWhat are the top 5 Data Science programs in the US?‚Äù

  üí° ‚ÄúWhere does Carnegie Mellon rank globally for AI?‚Äù

  üí° ‚ÄúDo any California colleges offer faculty-led AI research?‚Äù

3. Submit and Wait
 Click the "Submit" button. The app will:

 Route your query to the appropriate AI agents

 Process your request through structured (Snowflake), unstructured (Pinecone), or fallback (web search) pipelines

 Use LLMs to summarize and format the answer

4. View the Results
  You‚Äôll see a personalized answer that may include:

  Recommended colleges with key metrics

  A side-by-side comparison table

Global ranking data (if requested)

  Web-sourced content if no internal data matches

5. Export the Report
Optional: Download the results as a .txt file or Google Colab notebook (coming soon).

## Run the Application

1) Please run the main.py file using the command (uvicorn main:app --reload)
2) Next, open a new terminal window in the working directory and run the frontend.py file using the command (streamlit run frontend.py)


## Langgraph Flow

The LangGraph flow manages how prompts are routed through different agents (Snowflake, RAG, Web), using decision nodes and fallback mechanisms to ensure that the system always responds appropriately.

This LangGraph workflow is designed to handle college recommendation queries using a structured, multi-agent decision flow. It starts by verifying whether the user's query is relevant and safe (college-related and appropriate). If valid, it routes the query to a combined agent that aggregates results from Snowflake and RAG systems. If these sources return insufficient data, the system falls back to a web search agent to provide relevant recommendations. Finally, it compiles all gathered data‚Äîwhether from the core agents or fallback‚Äîand returns a structured output. The graph ensures robust handling of edge cases while prioritizing high-quality responses.
